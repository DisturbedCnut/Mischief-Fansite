		<h2>About Mischief</h2>
		<p>A human man named Percy found employment as a clown in the Dreamland amusement park. After a fire disaster, Percy joined the US Navy during WWII. In an attempt to utilize new technology on the ship Percy was stationed to invisible, the ship accidentally teleported to New York. Percy's shipmates were fused to the Hull during the incident, while Percy himself was completely destroyed - creating the transforming entity we know today as Mischief.</p>
